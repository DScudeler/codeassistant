# Code Assistant
A small project, educational trying to get interaction with AI within VS Code with a little more power than just auto complete.
- [x] use of docker for embedings in weaviate
- [ ] embed llama code into a container (TOOD)
- [x] test with source with llama code etc... (minor tetsing done)
- [ ] fine tuning of llm to create vs code commands (see if worth might wait for langchain integration)
- [ ] plugin to interact with VS Code (in progress)
- [ ] making an example project

## UI with VS Code
- Find a way to implement a chat with code assistant within vs code
- build a full application with langchain, custom tools etc...
